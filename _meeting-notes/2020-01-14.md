## :question: Questions (Blockers, Technical Design needs)
> We only have 30 mins for this section, use your time wisely

- (@handle) QUESTION
- (@aschmahmann) is the DHT's FindPeersConnectedToPeer used by anything? is it designed for debugging?
  - A: kill it and adapt the one tiny thing that's relying on it (@vyzo's crawler).
- (@aschmahmann) how many long term and short term connections are we willing to accept for DHT operation?
  - A: 200? Depends on how much they help. E.g., if 400 peers cuts us from 4 to 2 hops, yes.
- (@aschmahmann) rely on autonat or dialback?
  - A: rely on autonat for now
- (@aschmahmann) Should FindPeer shortcut?
  - A: No
