## :question: Questions (Blockers, Technical Design needs)
> We only have 30 mins for this section, use your time wisely

- (@daviddias) What's the state of SideCar?
  - status
    - patch for jitter 
    - WIP patch for filtering inbound connections
    - next subnet support
    - sidecar gets installed through the makefile (not done yet)
    - Will it work in macOS?
      - Yes
    - Should we have Vagrant to develop locally?
      - Doesn't seem necessary yet
    - Any help needed?
      - Review the jitter PR?
        - check https://github.com/ipfs/testground/blob/master/plans/dht/test/set-up.go#L26-L44 how it works
      - Does anyone want to own the makefile?
        - Yes -> Jim! <3 AI: do this 
- (@daviddias) What's the state of libp2p instrumentation?
  - AFAWK no work has gotten done on this
  - Some ideation happening (context vs internal logger) but none set in stone.
  - Jim has some old code (how old?). Revamping might take ~3 weeks
  - We will be using Uber Zap.
- (@nonsense) How do we name the project? Is it `TestGround` or `Test Ground` or `Testground`? I suggest we always use the first or the third, just so that we are consistent in code and docs.
  - @daviddias - I've been using TestGround & Test Ground but converging to `TestGround` <- the people like this one :)
  - for search purposes it is better to be one word.
- (@nonsense) Location of this call? Link at the top? Calendar entry differs from Hackmd link...
  - (@daviddias) Fixed!
- (@jimpick) Can we get a quick explanation of what the 'daemon' is?
  - AI(Anton): Write or link to where the daemon is documented
  - AI(??): Spec needs to be revisited asap
    - AI(Jim): Redline the spec in the areas that it is clearly out of date
- (@stebalien) Multiple libp2p versions?
  - No work done yet
  - How implement this?
    - Multiple Docker containers
    - Have multiple build steps 
  - How would one do this?
    - A) `testground build a && testground build b && testground run a+b`
    - B) Change the manifest?
    - C) Have it described in the main.go of the plan?
  - AI(Steven): Create an issue describing this design and a potential proposal

### OKRs for the Quarter
