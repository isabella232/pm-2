- ==@nonsense==
  - In progress
    - ...
  - Got done
      - Run a testplan with 500 and 1000 instances and review if we have to fix anything on the cluster_k8s.go runner
          - CNI <> sidecar race
          - Testplan retry / timeouts
          - Improved k8s setup (less steps thanks to reviews!)
          - OS host sysctl configs

  - Doctor's appointment conflict this week (will watch video)
  - Didn't get done (and had commited to last week)
    - Didn't get time to sync up to latest and update basic-tcp
- ==@aschmahmann==
  - Got done
    - Worked on DHT testplan to excercise the improvements from the improved query logic [PR](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-kad-dht/pull/436) (terminating queries + disjoint paths)
      - Fixed test issue caused by TCP simulataneous connect
      - Added ability to have undialable peers in the query
      - Added new bootstrapping method based on starting with a fully connected network and using the connection manager to trim them
      - Created some scripts to export connection graphs to graphviz
  - Didn't get done (and had commited to last week)
    - Writing a test that demonstrates choking the network
        - This is more complicated then anticipated since the existing DHT tests do not perform reasonable network forming (the way they use bootstrappers isn't conducive to forming well connected networks, especially with low k values)
    - Run 1k node DHT tests (was blocked on k8s improvements)
  - Blocked
    - ...
- ==@yusefnapora==
