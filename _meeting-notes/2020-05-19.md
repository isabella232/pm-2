## :question: Questions (Blockers, Technical Design needs)

### Testground/Infra Repo Refactor Design Review
- Notes from retro here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VmM3vuBWKbkWKkfXZetuKfo1C3vSn-gjpiJY3JAswgY/edit

    - notes

---




- Place-holder : Please add any additional Design Review Requests here for addition to next agenda

-  **Log and Metric Collections Async done. Does it need formal Design Review?**
    - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yZDRRw_c8ZiYL6z2SC4omQNDCEZJId3Ly3jZveFii9g/edit# - This has been resolved and can be tabled

### Blockers
- https://github.com/testground/testground/issues/875 Needs design discussion due to it blocking multiple other isses e.g. https://github.com/testground/testground/issues/599 - Raul building wireframes for 875. Removes blocker for 599. 599 now dependent on 937

---
- Still on Radar. Need to look into fault tolerances, set standards into the design
    - This is for a future sprint. Need issue to flesh out and work on design
    - Stages?
    - take one testplan (e.g.pubsub) and measure and annotate the failures for tolerance or improvement.

## :dart: Next

-  Timing of Sprint- v0.6 in process. Low intensity sprint this time
    -  Sprint Plan
-Bugs now in own pipeline so as to not compete with Features
-Issues only discussed in sync. Pr's can be mentioned in Daily Async, where respective discussion can be initiated
-Estimations, Think in terms of complexity, not time-tracking
